This is my portfolio website that I implemented using React and EmailJS libraries.

You can visit it here:

###Features:

You can download my CV, send me an email via contact form and find more information about me and my projects. By clicking on certain buttons in the project section, you can view the source code on GitHub for my projects. You can also visit my LinkedIn account and GitHub account.
The main focus of the project is on CSS styling. The website is responsive for mobile screen sizes as well.
